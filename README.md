- 👋 Hi, I’m @shubhodeepMitra
- 👀 I’m interested in Distributed Systems, Data Intensive Systems for Machine Learning, Database Systems, XR, and Mobile Applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently a RA at EMITLab, ASU under Dr. K. Selcuk Candan, working on NSF a funded project named DataStorm, an extensive data system to support data-driven simulations with necessary volume, velocity, and variety and integrate and optimize key aspects and decisions in disaster management.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on any interesting idea.
