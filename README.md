-   👋 Hi, I’m @shubhodeepMitra
-   👀 I’m interested in **Distributed Systems, Data-Intensive Systems for AI, Database Systems,** and **Mobile Applications.**

-   🌱 I’m currently an **RA** at **EMITLab**, **ASU**, under **Dr. K. Selçuk Candan**, working on an **NSF-funded** project named **DataStorm**, an extensive data system to support data-driven simulations with necessary **volume, velocity, and variety** and integrate and optimize key aspects and decisions in disaster management.

-   💼 With over **4 years of hands-on experience** in the tech industry, I've honed my expertise in **systems architecture** and the development of **large-scale infrastructure** in **C/C++.** At **Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE),** I was entrusted with leading several mission-critical initiatives.
    -   My work was instrumental in engineering the **IP Subinterface**, where I developed its capability to support **17 protocols**, ensuring seamless and reliable traffic flow across complex network environments.
    -   I spearheaded the redesign of **IGMP and MLD protocols**, integrating real-time packet flow monitoring that facilitated the validation of **data transmission accuracy and correctness.**
    -   I also led the development of **CLI infrastructure for Layer 2 protocols.** This involved integrating **VLAN management, VLAN Translation,** and **Multi-Zone User-Based Tunneling (UBT),** effectively enabling **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** features that empowered the network management teams with greater flexibility and control.

-   💻 I’m open to collaborating on **innovative ideas and challenging projects** that push the frontiers of technology that will challenge me and allow me to make a significant impact.

-   🔍 I'm particularly interested in roles related to **Software Development Engineering (SDE)**, 🤖 **AI Infrastructure**, and 🛠️ **Systems Engineering**.
